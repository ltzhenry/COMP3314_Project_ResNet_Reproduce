ResNet architectures for ImageNet (optional extension).

Implements ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 architectures as described in the original paper.

TODO:
    - Implement BasicBlock for ImageNet (18/34 layers)
    - Implement Bottleneck block (for ResNet-50+ if extending)
    - Implement ResNet_ImageNet class
    - Add constructors for ResNet18, ResNet34
