"""
Visualization utilities for training curves.

Generates plots matching Figure 6 from the ResNet paper showing 
training/test error comparison between plain and residual networks.

TODO:
    - Implement plot_training_curves(plain_history, resnet_history)
    - Plot training error vs iterations
    - Plot test error vs iterations
    - Match paper's Figure 6 layout
    - Save plots to results directory
