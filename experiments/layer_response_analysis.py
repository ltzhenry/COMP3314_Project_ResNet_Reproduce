"""
Layer response analysis for ResNet.

Reproduces analysis from Figure 7 of the ResNet paper showing 
standard deviation of layer responses for plain vs residual networks.

TODO:
    - Load trained plain and residual models
    - Extract layer responses/activations
    - Compute standard deviation per layer
    - Plot std vs layer depth
    - Match paper's Figure 7 layout
